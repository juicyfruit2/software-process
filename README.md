- Suggest which generic software model will be most appropriate for the
development of the following systems.
- Give reasons for your answer.
- A system to control anti-lock braking in a car
- A virtual reality system to support software maintenance
- A university accounting system that replaces an existing system
- An interactive travel planning system that helps users plan journeys
with the lowest environmental impact
- Why do you think incremental development is the most effective
approach for developing business software systems and less appropriate
for real-time systems engineering?
- Look at the diagram showing reuse-oriented software engineering above.
Why do you think it is necessary to have two separate requirements
engineering activities in this process?
